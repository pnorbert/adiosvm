Installation
------------
Detailed installation instructions at http://www.2decomp.org/install.html .

To install 2decomp_fft,

1. cd src
2. Copy an existing Makefile.inc.__ file to Makefile.inc .
    For example, on a local Linux machine, copy Makefile.inc.x86_64 to Makefile.inc. 
3. Verify you want to use FFTW3 as your FFT library. If not, change the variable `FFT` to something else, such as `mkl`.
4. Verify compilers for building the library. Currently they are set to mpif90 and mpicc. On Cray machines, you may need to change them to ftn and cc respectively.
4. Run `make` from the src/ directory.
