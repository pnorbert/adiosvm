This folder contains an applications using the Global Arrays toolkit (GA) to 
implement a 3D FFT. While the data is still distributed via 2DECOMP&FFT's 
decomposition library, there are no global transpositions. All comminications 
are done via GA, who encapsulated the communications and gives a shared-memory 
view of the global data.

To build this application, GA has to be installed first, and its path given in 
the Makefile.
