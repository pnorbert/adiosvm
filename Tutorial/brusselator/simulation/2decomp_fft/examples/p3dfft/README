p3dfft
------

This program

* Crosschecks the results computed by 2DECOMP&FFT and P3DFFT.
* Compares the performance of 2DECOMP&FFT and P3DFFT. 

Prerequisite:

* P3DFFT version 2.5.1 required (API not compatible with older versions)
* P3DFFT is installed at $P3DFFT_HOME and path set properly in Makefile.
* Both P3DFFT and 2DECOMP&FFT are built in double precision.
* P3DFFT is built with -DDIMS_C flag (same decomposition as 2DECOMP&FFT) 
* P3DFFT is built against FFTW; 2DECOMP&FFT can use any FFT engine.

What to expect:

* Results from P3DFFT and 2DECOMP&FFT should be almost the same, even when
  different FFT engines are used. As we are comparing large numbers (>>1),
  the difference should be small but not as small as machine accuracy.
* Each library should recover the input after one forward and one backward
  transform with errors reported close to machine accuracy.
